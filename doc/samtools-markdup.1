.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Mark duplicate alignments from a coordinate sorted file that
has been run through \fBsamtools fixmate\fR with the \fB-m\fR option.  This program
relies on the MC and ms tags that fixmate provides.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 11
.BI "-l " INT
.RI "Expected maximum read length of " INT " bases."
[300]
.TP
.B -r
Remove duplicate reads.
.TP
.B -s
Print some basic stats.
.TP
.BI "-T " PREFIX
Write temporary files to
.IB PREFIX . samtools . nnnn . mmmm . tmp
.TP
.B -S
Mark supplementary reads of duplicates as duplicates.
.TP
.BI "-f " file
Write stats to named file.
.TP
.BI "-d " distance
The optical duplicate distance.  Suggested settings of 100 for HiSeq style
platforms or about 2500 for NovaSeq ones.  Default is 0 to not look for
optical duplicates.  When set, duplicate reads are tagged with \fBdt:Z:SQ\fR for
optical duplicates and \fBdt:Z:LB\fR otherwise.  Calculation of distance depends
on coordinate data embedded in the read names produced by the Illumina
sequencing machines.  Optical duplicate detection will not work on non standard
names.
.TP
.B -c
Clear previous duplicate settings and tags.
.TP
.B -t
Mark duplicates with the name of the original in a \fBdo\fR tag.
.TP
.B --relaxed
An alternative algorithm for choosing which reads are duplicates.  Tends to
find more duplicates than the default though the results are largely the same.
.TP
.B --include-fails
Include quality checked failed reads (included in the above option).
.TP
.B --no-PG
Do not add a PG line to the output file.

.SH EXAMPLES
This first command sort can be omitted if the file is already name ordered:
.EX
samtools sort -n -o namesort.bam example.bam
.EE

Add ms and MC tags for markdup to use later:
.EX
samtools fixmate -m namesort.bam fixmate.bam
.EE

Markdup needs position order:
.EX
samtools sort -o positionsort.bam fixmate.bam
.EE

Finally mark duplicates:
.EX
samtools markdup positionsort.bam markdup.bam
.EE
